    <h2>OUR PRIVACY-FIRST APPROACH</h2>
    <p></p>
    <p>DuEasy is built with privacy at its core. We collect only the minimum data necessary to provide our services:</p>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your invoice images and PDFs are processed entirely on your device - we never upload them to our servers</li>
        <li>Only extracted text from invoices is sent to our cloud service for AI analysis (available on Free tier with monthly limits, or Pro tier with higher limits). Offline fallback uses on-device OCR and simple local parsing (no cloud AI)</li>
        <li>If you enable iCloud sync, your document data is stored in YOUR private iCloud account - we cannot access your iCloud data</li>
        <li>We do not use tracking or analytics for advertising purposes</li>
        <li>We do not collect browsing history, detailed usage patterns, or IP addresses for tracking</li>
        <li>Crash reports help us fix bugs but contain no personal or financial data from your documents</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p>We believe your financial documents are private and should stay on your device. Our architecture reflects this commitment.</p>

    <h2>3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
    <p>In Short:  We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e. , legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Consent.  We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e. , consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Learn more about  withdrawing your consent .</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Performance of a Contract. We may process your personal information when we believe it is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations to you, including providing our Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract with you.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Legitimate Interests. We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal information for some of the purposes described in order to:</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Diagnose problems and/or prevent fraudulent activities</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Legal Obligations. We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Vital Interests. We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e. , express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e. , implied consent). You can  withdraw your consent  at any time.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations</p>
    <p></p>

We have contracts in place with our third parties, which are designed to help safeguard your personal information. This means that they cannot do anything with your personal information unless we have instructed them to do it. They will also not share your personal information with any organization apart from us.

    <p></p>

    <p></p>
    <h2>5. DO WE OFFER ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE-BASED PRODUCTS?</h2>
    <p>In Short:  We offer products, features, or tools powered by artificial intelligence, machine learning, or similar technologies.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>As part of our Services, we offer products, features, or tools powered by artificial intelligence, machine learning, or similar technologies (collectively, " AI Products " ). These tools are designed to enhance your experience and provide you with innovative solutions. The terms in this Privacy Notice govern your use of the AI Products within our Services.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Our AI Products</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Our AI Products are designed for the following functions:</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Text analysis - extracting structured data from invoice text</p>
    <p>AI automation - automatically categorizing and organizing financial documents</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>What Data is Sent to AI Services</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>We send ONLY extracted OCR text from your invoices to our AI provider for analysis. Specifically:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Text extracted from invoices (vendor names, amounts, dates, descriptions)</li>
        <li>NO images or PDF files are ever sent to AI services</li>
        <li>NO device identifiers or personal information beyond the invoice text</li>
        <li>We send only the minimum text required for analysis</li>
        <li>We do not use your invoice data for advertising or marketing purposes</li>
        <li>We configure AI providers to minimize data retention where technically available</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p>The AI analysis happens in the cloud (when enabled) but follows a strict privacy-first model. We use business-tier API access with enterprise data processing agreements where available to limit data retention by AI providers.</p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>IMAGE PROCESSING AND PRIVACY</h2>
    <p></p>
    <p>DuEasy processes invoice images and PDFs entirely on your device. We do not upload or transmit your document images or PDFs to our servers or third-party services.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Here's how it works:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Images/PDFs are processed locally on your device using on-device OCR (Optical Character Recognition)</li>
        <li>Only the extracted text data from your invoices is sent to our cloud service for analysis</li>
        <li>Your original images and PDFs remain on your device and are never transmitted</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p>This local-first approach ensures your sensitive financial documents stay private and secure on your device.</p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>ICLOUD SYNC AND BACKUP</h2>
    <p></p>
    <p>DuEasy offers optional iCloud synchronization and backup features to keep your data in sync across your Apple devices.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>How iCloud Sync Works:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>All data is stored in YOUR private iCloud account using Apple's CloudKit service</li>
        <li>Your document data (extracted information, due dates, reminders) syncs between your devices signed in with the same Apple ID</li>
        <li>We do not have access to your iCloud data - it is stored in your private iCloud container</li>
        <li>Apple manages the storage, encryption, and synchronization</li>
        <li>You can disable iCloud sync at any time in the app settings</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p>iCloud Backup:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If enabled, encrypted backups of your document data are stored in your iCloud Drive</li>
        <li>Backups are encrypted with AES-256-GCM encryption before being uploaded</li>
        <li>We cannot access or decrypt your iCloud backups</li>
        <li>You control backup retention and can delete backups at any time</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p>Important Notes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>iCloud sync is optional - you can use DuEasy entirely on-device without iCloud</li>
        <li>Apple is the data processor for iCloud storage, not DuEasy</li>
        <li>Your data in iCloud is subject to Apple's Privacy Policy: https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/</li>
        <li>iCloud storage uses your iCloud storage quota</li>
        <li>Syncing requires an active internet connection</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>

    <h2>6. IS YOUR INFORMATION TRANSFERRED INTERNATIONALLY?</h2>

    <p></p>
    <p>We have implemented measures to protect your personal information, including by using the European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information between our group companies and between us and our third-party providers. These clauses require all recipients to protect all personal information that they process originating from the EEA or UK in accordance with European data protection laws and regulations.   Our Standard Contractual Clauses can be provided upon request.   We have implemented similar appropriate safeguards with our third-party service providers and partners and further details can be provided upon request.</p>

    <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for as long as you have an account with us .</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

    <h2>8. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
    <p>In Short:  We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</p>

    <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>

If a decision that produces legal or similarly significant effects is made solely by automated means, we will inform you, explain the main factors, and offer a simple way to request human review. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section " HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE? " below.</p>

You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section " HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE? " below .</p>

    <h2>11. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
    <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ( "DNT" ) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized . As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.</p>
